          This tool is part of the  Samba suite.

          smbpasswd is the Samba encrypted password file. It contains
          the username, Unix user id and the SMB hashed passwords of
          the user, as well as account flag information and the time
          the password was last changed. This file format has been
          evolving with Samba and has had several different formats in
          the past.

          The format of the smbpasswd file used by Samba 2.2 is very
          similar to the familiar Unix _p_a_s_s_w_d(_5) file. It is an ASCII
          file containing one line for each user. Each field within
          each line is separated from the next by a colon. Any entry
          beginning with '#' is ignored. The smbpasswd file contains
          the following information for each user:

          nnnnaaaammmmeeee This is the user name. It must be a name that already
               exists in the standard UNIX passwd file.

          uuuuiiiidddd  This is the UNIX uid. It must match the uid field for
               the same user entry in the standard UNIX passwd file.
               If this does not match then Samba will refuse to
               recognize this smbpasswd file entry as being valid for
               a user.

               This is the LANMAN hash of the user's password, encoded
               as 32 hex digits. The LANMAN hash is created by DES
               encrypting a well known string with the user's password
               as the DES key. This is the same password used by
               Windows 95/98 machines. Note that this password hash is
               regarded as weak as it is vulnerable to dictionary
               attacks and if two users choose the same password this
               entry will be identical (i.e. the password is not
               "salted" as the UNIX password is). If the user has a
               null password this field will contain the characters
               "NO PASSWORD" as the start of the hex string. If the
               hex string is equal to 32 'X' characters then the
               user's account is marked as disabled and the user will
               not be able to log onto the Samba server.

               To protect these passwords the smbpasswd file is placed
               in a directory with read and traverse access only to
               the root user and the smbpasswd file itself must be set
               to be read/write only by root, with no other access.

               This is the Windows NT hash of the user's password,
               encoded as 32 hex digits. The Windows NT hash is
               created by taking the user's password as represented in
               16-bit, little-endian UNICODE and then applying the MD4
               (internet rfc1321) hashing algorithm to it.

               This password hash is considered more secure than the
               LANMAN Password Hash as it preserves the case of the
               password and uses a much higher quality hashing
               algorithm. However, it is still the case that if two
               users choose the same password this entry will be
               identical (i.e. the password is not "salted" as the
               UNIX password is).

               This section contains flags that describe the
               attributes of the users account. In the Samba 2.2
               release this field is bracketed by '[' and ']'
               characters and is always 13 characters in length
               (including the '[' and ']' characters).  The contents
               of this field may be any of the characters.

               o+ UUUU - This means this is a "User" account, i.e. an
                 ordinary user. Only User and Workstation Trust
                 accounts are currently supported in the smbpasswd
                 file.

               o+ NNNN - This means the account has no password (the
                 passwords in the fields LANMAN Password Hash and NT
                 Password Hash are ignored). Note that this will only
                 allow users to log on with no password if the  _n_u_l_l
                 _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_s parameter is set in the _s_m_b._c_o_n_f(_5)

               o+ WWWW - This means this account is a "Workstation Trust"
                 account. This kind of account is used in the Samba
                 PDC code stream to allow Windows NT Workstations and
                 Servers to join a Domain hosted by a Samba PDC.

          The original Samba software and related utilities were
          created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
          Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
          Linux kernel is developed.

          The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The
          man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
          excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
          ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/
          <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the
          Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to
          DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
