Instructions:	Preparing Samba Packages for SCO OpenServer
===============================================================

We provide support only for current versions of SCO OpenServer

To produce the custom installable media images simply type (in this directory):
	# ./Makevol

The resultant samba media images should reside in the ./dist subdirectory.
To install from the media images, issue the command (as root):

        # cd dist
        # ./Install

Alternately, each of the steps in building the media images may be performed
individually by invoking each of the following:

        # ./Configure
        # ./Compile
        # ./Install
        # ./Package

If files are added or deleted from the SCO OpenServer Samba distribution then
the prototype file in the pkg directory should be appropriately modified.
The files in the pkg subdirectory were initially created using the mkpkg
package from SCO Skunkware (see http://www.sco.com/skunkware).
