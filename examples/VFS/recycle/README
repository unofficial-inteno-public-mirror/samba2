The recycle VFS module implements a recycle bin for Samba.
Deleted files will be moved to a special directory and
not be deleted unless specified in the configuration file.
It is up to the administrator/user to clean up the files
in the recycle bin.

Installation:

1. Build VFS module using the GNU autoconf script and Makefile 
   in the parent directory (cd .. && ./configure && make)
2. Install module by copying to /usr/lib/samba/vfs (or any other place you like)
3. Install/modify recycle.conf. See below for the description
4. Modify smb.conf to use the recycle module
   Add the lines "vfs object = /usr/lib/samba/recycle.so"
   and "vfs options = /etc/samba/recycle.conf".
5. Start Samba


Options for recycle.conf:
name
	name of the recycle bin at root level of the share
	allows smb.conf substutitions like %U.
	Example:
	  name = .recycle/%U

mode	
	KEEP_DIRECTORIES : retain directory hierarchy of deleted file,
	VERSIONS : create several versions of a file in recycle bin if
	           the file already exists in the recycle bin
		    e.g.	mytext.doc
				Copy #1 of mytext.doc
				Copy #2 of mytext.doc

        TOUCH : touch access date when moving files to the recycle bin.
	        This is useful for automatic cleanup scripts.
		Attn: This doesn't work if you have no write permissions
		      to the file being deleted. Deletion works if you
		      have write permissions to the parent directory.
	Example:
	  mode = KEEP_DIRECTORIES|VERSIONS|TOUCH

maxsize
	maximum size of files to be moved to recycle bin. Setting this zo
	zero (default) moves files of any size to the recycle bin.
	Example:
	  maxsize = 0

exclude
	exclude files from moving to recycle bin. Delete them immediately
	Useful for temporary files. You can use the wildcards * and ? 
	Example:
	  exclude = *.tmp|*.temp|*.obj|~$*|*.$$$

excludedir
	exclude directories from the recycle bin, useful for temporary
	directories.
	Example
	  excludedir = /tmp|/temp|/trash

noversions
	don't create versions of files in the recycle bin. Only usefull if
	mode = VERSIONS is set.
	Examples:
	  noversions = *.doc|*.xls|*.ppt

Example smb.conf:

[homes]
        comment = Home-directory
        path = /home/%u
        read only = No
        create mask = 0750
        vfs object = /usr/lib/samba/recycle.so
        vfs options = /etc/samba/recycle.conf

Example recycle.conf:

name = .recycle/%U
mode = KEEP_DIRECTORIES|NOVERSIONS|TOUCH
maxsize = 0
exclude = *.tmp|*.temp|*.o|*.obj|~$*
excludedir = /tmp|/temp|/cache
noversions = *.doc|*.xls|*.ppt
